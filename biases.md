**Source Attribution Bias:** Persistently questioning the authenticity of information sources that contradict oneâ€™s beliefs, often due to an unwillingness to reconsider initial views, frequently dismissing evidence as "photoshopped" or generated by AI as a convenient means of rejection.

This bias often occurs in succession, starting with claims that a photo is photoshopped and later attributing video evidence to AI, forming a recurring pattern of streamlined rejection. It is commonly observed among individuals in respective academic fields, respective religions, respective territories, respective communities, and respective belief understandings, who perceive the world through their narrow, respective viewpoints.
